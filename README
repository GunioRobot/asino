== Welcome to asino

asino is a small rails project that helps users of Saldomat to manage their private finances.
It receives account transactions from Saldomats RSS feeds, so these need to be enabled in Saldomat.
asino is intended to run on a local machine, not a server that is accessible from the internet.


== Getting Started

1. clone the app code from github: git clone git@github.com:agehret/asino.git
2. run rake gems:install
3. run rake db:setup
4. run rake db:migrate
5. start your local server


== Prerequisites

By default, asino uses MySQL, so you should have a running instance
